This Sunday I finally disassembled and cleaned my notebook, which was suffering with overheating for almost a year. It's a **Dell Inspiron 14R** (N4110), and as my previous one (an **Acer TravelMate 5120**), it was working fine for just 5 minutes before starting to fail. Trying to get more info about, I installed programs to set processor's mode (always *conservative*) and a temperature monitor. After those initial 5 minutes, the 2 physical cores (it's a core i5) were at 80 degrees Celsius. In 20 minutes, the computer shut down.

What I did? I "installed" a new fan and it worked for a while.

But it wasn't the ideal solution. There was a lot of noise, sometimes my sister wanted it back and the portability was an issue. So I took courage to disassemble the motherfucker, downloaded the manual from Dell' site and opened it correctly (but the **DELETE** will never be the same). After removing the fan, there was so much dusty accumulated it looked like grey cotton. And then I confirmed my suspicions: it was very easy to dust enter through the air exit, but very difficult to remove it (*genius*). The dust was so cohesive that even a vacuum couldn't solve. Cleaned, closed, ready to work.

But how is it designed to fail? Well, we know for experience that notebooks "must" be changed every 2 years. It's when novelties debunks your **<a href="http://www.squaretrade.com/htm/pdf/SquareTrade_laptop_reliability_1109.pdf" target="_blank">old piece of crap</a>**. Even knowing my core i5 with 4 GB of RAM and a disc of 750 GB would be enough for me for the next 3 years, I was dreaming about those slim ultrabooks with SSD storage, 6 hours of battery and all the coolness I could have. Sometimes the dream changed to a powerful desktop capable to run GTA 5 in maximum quality. But the annoying fact is: **we are consumers, trained to buy every new useless gadget**, and for this to happen, our equipment must fail on schedule. It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence" target="_blank">planned obsolescence</a>, a policy of designing a product to stop working properly within a predicted time. That's why a new *iSomething* is released in less than a year.

There's some initiatives to change this scenario like <a href="https://phonebloks.com/en/goals" target="_blank">Phonebloks</a>, but it will only happen with big players' blessing, aka never. So, the key to *hack* the planned obsolescence is stop being a mindless consumer and trying to understand how things work so you can fix them instead of just buying new shinning shits.

Fortunately the fever is over and hal9000 can work for hours in the arctic 60 degrees Celsius.
