Last <a title="Neural networks in a nutshell" href="http://themenwhostareatcodes.wordpress.com/2014/03/02/neural-networks-in-a-nutshell/" target="_blank">post</a> I showed the *McCulloch-Pitts neuron*, which main difference to a more wide model is the *threshold function*. Continuing this subject for while, I will talk briefly about other existent *activation functions*. Pay attention to the fact the neuron structure is the same, the only difference being how it fires.

The so called *unit step function* has an abrupt change in value when reaches `x = 0`, but it can be either a *treshold function* (limited between `0` and `1`), or a *signal function* (output between `-1` and `1`), as shown in *Fig. 4*. However this change doesn't happens in the real neuron. It's not binary, but more smooth, going from the lower limit and growing until the upper limit, shaped like an **S**. The *sigmoid function* has this shape, as shown in *Fig. 5*, and the two cases demonstrated here are the *logistic sigmoid* (*Eq. 3*) and the *hyperbolic tangent* (*Eq. 4*) functions.

- (3) $latex \varphi(v) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-av}}$, with $latex \varphi(v)$ between `0` and `1`.
- (4) $latex \varphi(v) = tanh(v) = \frac{e^v - e^{-v}}{e^v + e^{-v}}$, with $latex \varphi(v)$ between `-1` and `1`.

Also, another caracteristic of these functions is they are *differentiable*, while the *unit step* is not, what will prove to be an importante feature still in this post.

So, now, a piece of code. Using the code from the previous post we will build a more general model of a neuron, containing the *logsig* (with `a = 1`) and *tansig* functions:

[code language="python"]
from math import exp, tanh


def treshold(x):
    if x &gt;= 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def signal(x):
    if x &gt;= 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return -1

def logsig(x):
    return (1 / (1 + exp(-x)))

tansig = tanh
[/code]

Also a class defining a general Neuron. Notice the default value for parameter *activation* in `Neuron.__init__`

[code language="python"]
class Neuron(object):

    def __init__(self, weights, bias, activation=treshold):
        self.weights = weights
        self.bias = bias
        self.activation = activation

    def fire(self, inputs):
        summed = sum([i*w for (i,w) in zip(inputs, self.weights)])
        return self.activation(summed + self.bias)
[/code]

indicating that given no *activation function*, our neuron is a *McCulloch-Pitts*. And the tests

[code language="python"]
if __name__ == '__main__':
    neuron_1 = Neuron([0.4, 0.6, 0.9], -0.8)
    neuron_2 = Neuron([0.4, 0.6, 0.9], -1.5, signal)
    neuron_3 = Neuron([0.4, 0.6, 0.9], -0.8, logsig)
    neuron_4 = Neuron([0.4, 0.6, 0.9], -0.8, tansig)

    inputs = [1, 0, 1]

    print('Test #1 - inputs on neuron_1:', neuron_1.fire(inputs))
    print('Test #1 - inputs on neuron_2:', neuron_2.fire(inputs))
    print('Test #1 - inputs on neuron_3:', neuron_3.fire(inputs))
    print('Test #1 - inputs on neuron_4:', neuron_4.fire(inputs))
[/code]

```

showing the infinite range of values a neuron with *sigmoid activation function* produces.

Now we know an ANN is a distributed parallel system composed of very simple processing units (*neurons*) interconnected and how these units work, it's time to learn about some topologies. In this post we will talk about the perceptrons, which are *feedforward neural networks*. The nexts will cover more elaborated ones.

## 2 - Perceptron

The *Perceptron* was the first algorithmically described neural network (and is the simplest). It was invented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt" target="_blank">*Frank Rosenblatt*</a> in 1958 and is a model for learning with a teacher (*supervised learning*). It is used to classify patterns *linearly separable* (patterns that lie on opposite sides of a hyerplane). Basically, the *Perceptron* is a single neuron, that can only classify examples belonging to two *linearly separable* classes. Others configurations can use more than a neuron per layer, but the classes must be all *linearly separable*.

Depending of the source consulted, the *McCulloch-Pitts* model can use the *treshold function* or the *signal function* to activate the neuron. Previously we defined the model using the *treshold function*, but we will loose this definition a little, to maintain the consistency with the sources (shown in the *references* section at the end of the post). So now, our neuron will use the *signal function*.

[caption id="attachment_370" align="aligncenter" width="360"]<a href="http://themenwhostareatcodes.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/figure-06.png"><img class=" wp-image-370  " alt="Figure 6 Signal-flow graph of the perceptron." src="http://themenwhostareatcodes.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/figure-06.png?w=300" width="360" height="174" /></a> <strong>Figure 6</strong> Signal-flow graph of the perceptron.[/caption]

As shown in *Fig. 6*, the *Perceptron* with a single neuron is equal to the diagram of *Fig. 1*. Soon I will show why we had to change the *activation function* of the MCP neuron. Still according to *Fig. 6*, the total input $latex v$ is given by *Eq. 5*

- (5) $latex v = \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j x_j + b$

The goal is to correctly classify the inputs into classes `C1` (if $latex \varphi(v) = +1$) or `C2` (if $latex \varphi(v) = -1$). So, we need to define a border, and that's when *Eq. 5* is `0` ($latex v = 0$ arbitrarily belongs to class `C1` as $latex \varphi(0) = +1$), as shown in *Eq. 6*:

- (6) $latex v = \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j x_j + b = 0$

With this equation we can plot a map of the decision regions in the *m*-dimensional space. In the simplest case (one neuron) there are two decision regions separated by a *hyperplane*, as defined by *Eq. 6*. The *Fig. 7* illustrates the case with two inputs, for which the boundary takes a form of a straight line. Each point $latex (x_1, x_2)$ above the boundary line belongs to class `C1` and each point below the boundary line belongs to class `C2`. Note the bias *b* just shift the line away from the origin.

Here is the code for the Perceptron:

[code language="python"]
from neuron import signal, Neuron


class Perceptron(Neuron):

    def __init__(self, input_size, lrn_rate=1, weights=None, bias=0):
        """'input_size' is the length of the input.
        'lrn_rate' is the learning rate.
        """
        if not weights:
            weights = [0]*input_size
        super().__init__(weights, bias, signal)
        self.lrn_rate = lrn_rate

    def train(self, examples, epochs=1):
        """'examples' is a list of tuples (input_vector, desired_output)
        """
        for i in range(epochs):
            for example in examples:
                (input_vector, desired_output) = example
                actual_output = self.fire(input_vector)
                error = desired_output - actual_output

                self.weights = [(w + self.lrn_rate*error*x) for (w, x) in
                                zip(self.weights, input_vector)]
                self.bias = self.bias + self.lrn_rate*error

    def load_test(self, examples):
        total = len(examples)
        error = 0
        for example in examples:
            (input_vector, desired_output) = example
            actual_output = self.fire(input_vector)
            if desired_output != actual_output:
                error = error + 1

        return error/total

    def validate(self, examples, max_error):
        error = self.load_test(examples)
        return (max_error > error, error)

    def __str__(self):
        ret = super().__str__()

        return ret
[/code]

The default parameters in the \__init\__ method creates a *virgin* Perceptron (*bias* and *weights* zero). The learning rate for this case can be `1`, but a smaller one makes the learning more solid (but slower). I will skip the method `train()` to detail it more. The `load_test` takes a list of tuples `(input_vector, desired_output)` and check test for each one, returning a ratio between the number of errors and the number of examples. The method `validate` execute the `load_test` and check if the error rate is acceptable. It returns a tuple containing a `boolean` (it was validated or not) and the error rate.

The method `train()` runs the examples a number of iterations defined by the variable `epochs`. This variable is necessary because sometimes, even after thousands of examples, the *net* isn't well trained, so the weights must be adjusted again. For each `epoch`, all examples are tested and for each, the weights (and the bias) are changed according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory" target="_blank">*Hebb's rule*</a>. Each example's *actual output* is compared to the *correct output* provided, giving the error, which is multiplied by the *learning rate* and the corresponding input, and then added to the weight. The speed the weight changes is controlled by the *learning rate*. Remember that the method `train()` is effective only for an untrained *net*, that usually is a *virgin* one.

Now, here there's a not so clean code to train, validate and test the Perceptron:

[code language="python"]
def __classify__(y, x, a, b):
    if y >= a*x + b:
        return 1 # class C1
    return -1 # class C2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys, json, os, os.path
    from random import choice, uniform

    params = sys.argv[1 : ]
    # params: lrn_rate epochs num_training num_validation max_error num_test a b
    # from 'y = a*x + b'
    lrn_rate = float(params[1])
    epochs = int(params[2])
    num_training = int(params[3])
    num_validation = int(params[4])
    max_error = float(params[5])
    num_test = int(params[6])
    a = float(params[7])
    b = float(params[8])

    perceptron = Perceptron(2, lrn_rate)

    print('PRE-TRAINING:\n', perceptron, sep='')

    examples = []
    for _ in range(num_training):
        x1 = uniform(-1, 1)
        x2 = uniform(-1, 1)
        example = ([x1, x2], __classify__(x1, x2, a, b))
        examples.append(example)

    print('\ntraining')
    perceptron.train(examples, epochs)
    print('\nPOS-TRAINING:\n', perceptron, sep='')

    examples = []
    for _ in range(num_validation):
        x1 = uniform(-1, 1)
        x2 = uniform(-1, 1)
        example = ([x1, x2], __classify__(x1, x2, a, b))
        examples.append(example)

    print('\nvalidating')
    validation_error = perceptron.validate(examples, max_error)

    examples = []
    for _ in range(num_test):
        x1 = uniform(-1, 1)
        x2 = uniform(-1, 1)
        example = ([x1, x2], __classify__(x1, x2, a, b))
        examples.append(example)

    print('\ntesting')
    test_error = perceptron.load_test(examples)

    # name: perceptron_lrnRate_epochs_numExamples_a_b
    # format: weights bias activation
    nethash = hash(perceptron)
    filename = 'nets/trained_net_%s.json' % nethash
    if not os.path.exists('nets'):
        os.makedirs('nets')
    with open(filename, 'w') as netfile:
        net_params = {'type' : 'perceptron', 'lrn_rate' : lrn_rate,
                      'epochs' : epochs, 'num_training' : num_training,
                      'num_validation' : num_validation, 'num_test' : num_test,
                      'max_error' : max_error, 'a' : a, 'b' : b}
        net_attr = {'bias' : perceptron.bias, 'weights' : perceptron.weights,
                    'activation' : perceptron.activation.__name__,
                    'lrn_rate' : perceptron.lrn_rate}
        net = {'net_params' : net_params, 'net_attr' : net_attr,
               'validation_error' : validation_error, 'test_error' : test_error}
        netfile.write(json.dumps(net, indent=4, sort_keys=True))

    print('\nsaved on', filename)
[/code]

The command line to execute this code is `python3.3 perceptrons.py lrn_rate epochs num_training num_validation max_error num_test a b`, where `max_error` is the limit to validate the Perceptron and `a` and `b` are the parameters of a straight line dividing the classes. In the <a href="https://github.com/embatbr/The-Men-Who-Stare-at-Codes/tree/master/posts/neural-networks-in-a-nutshell-2" target="_blank">post repository</a> there's some examples of *nets*.
