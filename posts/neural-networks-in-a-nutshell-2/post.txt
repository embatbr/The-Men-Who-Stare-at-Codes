Last <a title="Neural networks in a nutshell" href="http://themenwhostareatcodes.wordpress.com/2014/03/02/neural-networks-in-a-nutshell/" target="_blank">post</a> I showed the *McCulloch-Pitts neuron*, which main difference to a more wide model is the binary *activation function*. Continuing this subject for while, I will talk briefly about other existent *activation functions*. Pay attention to the fact the neuron structure is the same, the only difference being how it fires.

The *Heaviside function* is also called *unit step function* because it has an abrupt change in value when reaches `x = 0`. However this change doesn't happens in the real neuron. It's not binary, but more smooth, going from (almost) nothing and growing until reach it's limit. Is shaped more like a **S**. The *sigmoid function* has this shape, as shown in *Fig. 1*, and the two cases demonstrated here are the *logistic sigmoid* (*Eq. 3*) and the *hyperbolic tangent* (*Eq. 4*).

- (3) $latex \varphi(v) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-av}}$, with $latex \varphi(v)$ between `0` and `1`.
- (4) $latex \varphi(v) = tanh(v) = \frac{e^v - e^{-v}}{e^v + e^{-v}}$, with $latex \varphi(v)$ between `-1` and `1`.

Also, another caracteristic is these functions are *differentiable*, while the *unit step* is not, what will prove to be an importante feature still in this post.

So, now, a piece of code. Using the code from the previous post we will build a more general model of a neuron, containing the *logsig* (with `a = 1`) and *tansig* functions:

[code language="python"]
from math import exp, tanh


def unit_step(x):
    if x >= 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def logsig(x):
    return (1 / (1 + exp(-x)))

tansig = tanh
[/code]

Also a class defining a general Neuron. Notice the default value for parameter *activation* in `Neuron.__init__`

[code language="python"]
class Neuron(object):

    def __init__(self, weights, bias, activation=unit_step):
        self.weights = weights
        self.bias = bias
        self.activation = activation

    def fire(self, inputs):
        summed = sum([i*w for (i,w) in zip(inputs, self.weights)])
        return self.activation(summed + self.bias)
[/code]

indicating that given no *activation function*, our neuron is a *McCulloch-Pitts* one. And the tests

[code language="python"]
if __name__ == '__main__':
    neuron_1 = Neuron([0.4, 0.6, 0.9], -0.8)
    neuron_2 = Neuron([0.4, 0.6, 0.9], -0.8, logsig)
    neuron_3 = Neuron([0.4, 0.6, 0.9], -0.8, tansig)

    inputs = [1, 0, 1]

    print('Test #1 - inputs on neuron_1:', neuron_1.fire(inputs))
    print('Test #1 - inputs on neuron_2:', neuron_2.fire(inputs))
    print('Test #1 - inputs on neuron_3:', neuron_3.fire(inputs))
[/code]

```
embat@hal9000:~/desktop/neural$ python3.3 neuron.py
Test #1 - inputs on neuron_1: 1
Test #1 - inputs on neuron_2: 0.6224593312018546
Test #1 - inputs on neuron_3: 0.46211715726000974
embat@hal9000:~/desktop/neural$
```

showing the infinite range of values a non*McCulloch-Pitts* neuron produces.

This fase done, it's time to study the perceptrons.
