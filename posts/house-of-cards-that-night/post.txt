March 13 of 2014 was a Thursday, and as usual I was going to watch some TV show before my rejuvenating sleep. This time the choice was the fresh released second season of **House of Cards**. For motives of a high power (aka *Netflix' rehab*) I had to download it with buccaneer friends, along with some subtitles (in English *of course*!). But with my internet access suspended due to lack of payment (thanks **42 days Postal strike** - the answer for all shit job's problems) I had to get it while in the grad's lab.

It's normal to get the wrong subtitle, and the correct way to deal with it is downloading the correct one. Without contact to the outer world, I had to improvise. In this moment, pythonic skills comes and within some hours (remember: *!internet -> !google* and *!sleep -> Australopithecus' mind*) the <a href="https://github.com/embatbr/subtitler" target="_blank">subtitler</a> is ready.

As that law created by *Robocop's dad*, it didn't work. The subtitles wasn't wrong just by forwarded time, but totally desynchronized. At least I had some hours of fun. Maybe I should get back to the neural nets, identify when and what the characters are talking and adjust the subtitles that way! Easy as pie...

**Live long and prosper**
